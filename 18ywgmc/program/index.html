  <p><em>Title:</em> Van est maps: the relation between the cohomology of Lie groups and the cohomology of Lie algebras</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">The classical Van Est theory relates the smooth cohomology of Lie groups with the cohomology of the associated Lie algebra, or its relative versions. Some aspects of this theory generalize to Lie groupoids and their Lie algebroids. We will revisit the van Est theory using the Perturbation Lemma from homological algebra. Using this technique, we will obtain precise results for the van Est differentiation and integrations maps at the level of cochains. Specifically, we will construct homotopy inverses to the van Est differentiation maps that are right inverses at the cochain level.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Safety-guarantees with data-driven controls based on  Gaussian processes for quadrotors UAVs and multi-agent systems</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="justify">The modeling and identification of dynamical systems is of great importance in a large range of domains including physics, engineering, biology, and chemistry. Applications range from model-based control of autonomous systems and the perception of dynamical objects to the understanding of complex reaction processes in chemical reactors. Whereas classical models of physical systems are typically based on first principles, there is a recent shift to more data-driven modeling of complex dynamics to capture more details in a more efficient manner. However, this paradigmatic shift introduces new questions regarding the efficiency, interpretability, and physical correctness of the model, that is, the learned model respects physical principles such as preservation of the constraints, volume, and energy. Including physical principles in a data-driven approach is beneficial in several ways: the models are meaningful as they respect the postulates of physics, come with increased interpretability, and can be more data-efficient as the satisfaction of physical axioms, which results in a meaningful inductive bias for the outputs of the model.</p>

  <p class="justify">Data-driven models require only minimal prior knowledge to model complex dynamics, and they are not limited to a finite set of parameters, as happens with typical system identification methods. Probably, the most widely studied data-driven technique for modeling dynamical systems, together with Gaussian Mixture Models and Hidden Markov Models, is the theory of Gaussian Processes (GPs) due to its characteristic of describing the dynamics with small training datasets and high probabilities. This technique is based on Bayesian methods. The Bayesian methodology is a probabilistic construction allowing the combination of new information with existent information: by using Bayes’ theorem, current knowledge is combined with the information of new data to improve the knowledge. An alternative to the Bayesian approach for learning-based modeling of dynamical systems is the use of Neural Networks (NNs) and Reinforce Learning (RL).</p>

  <p class="mb-5 justify">In recent years, there have been advances in the use of RL to learn dynamical systems and design controllers driven by data. Nevertheless, for complex nonlinear dynamics such as the coordinated motion of multiple mechanical systems, the training with RL does not provide an uncertainty quantification of the prediction outputs and can have difficulty generalizing from sparse data. For this reason, in this mini-course, we focus on modeling with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), a supervised learning technique based on GPs, so that the online learning provides a quantified uncertainty of the prediction and also provides training and update of predictions in real-time in comparison with classical NNs and RL. This uncertainty calculation is very valuable because it provides probabilistic safety guarantees for the system, that is, it provides probabilistic error bounds for the predictions using GPs that can be used, for instance, as ultimate bounds for the tracking error of autonomous vehicles to reach a desired trajectory which is the main application we will explore in the mini course.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Hamiltonian and Lagrangian perspectives on integrable systems</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">Classical integrable systems are traditionally formulated in terms of Hamiltonian mechanics. We will review this perspective, with the Liouville-Arnold theorem as a key result, and contrast it with a much more recent approach to integrable systems based on Lagrangian mechanics. The central objects in this approach are known as "Lagrangian multiforms" or "pluri-Lagrangian systems". After developing both perspectives for integrable ODEs, we will briefly discuss some other versions of Lagrangian multiform theory, applicable to integrable PDEs, differential-difference equations, and fully discrete lattice equations.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Safe online learning-based control for an aerial robot with manipulator arms</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">We present a learning-based tracking controller based on Gaussian processes (GP) for the tracking control of an aerial vehicle equipped with manipulator arms. We present how to design the controllers for our system with partially unknown dynamics.  We employ GP regression in order to compensate for the unknown dynamics of the system. In particular, the proposed control law provides asymptotic stability while tracking a desired trajectory and provides safety guarantees, that is, we can give a prediction of the uncertainty determined by the unknown dynamics.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Integrable and chaotic generalizations of the rolling of a convex body without slipping on a plane</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">The problem of a convex body rolling without slipping on a plane is a classic example in nonholonomic mechanics. In the literature there are several examples of affine variations of this system, in particular, solids rolling on a plane whose points move according to the flow of a given vector field. We will consider a further generalization of this problem in which we also allow the points on the surface of the body to move following the flow of another vector field.  During the talk, I will present the equations of motion in the most general case and discuss special cases of existence of first integrals and a smooth invariant measure. This information will allow us to show that the dynamics ranges from integrable to chaotic according to the specifics of the system. I will also discuss how some of these systems can be physically realized and describe some remarkable phenomena exhibited in some very special cases.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> On the stability of contact Hamiltonian systems</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">In this talk, different techniques to study the stability properties of the zeros of contact Hamiltonian vector fields will be explained. Furthermore, a criteria to ensure that a dynamical system on an odd-dimensional manifold can be described as a contact Hamiltonian system will be provided. The so-called dissipated quantities (which, in several aspects, amount to conserved quantities in Hamiltonian systems) are utilised to  investigate the stability of contact Hamiltonian systems.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Virtual constraints on Lie groups</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">Virtual constraints are relations imposed on a control system that become invariant via feedback control, as opposed to physical constraints acting on the system. Nonholonomic systems are mechanical systems with non-integrable constraints on the velocities. In this talk, we introduce the notion of virtual nonholonomic constraints on a Lie group in a geometric framework which is a controlled invariant subspace of the Lie algebra associated with the Lie group, and we show the existence and uniqueness of a control law preserving this subspace. We illustrate the theory with various examples and present simulation results for an application.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Floer theory in the analysis of Hamiltonian systems</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">Modern symplectic geometry started as a mathematical formulation of classical mechanics. Examples of Hamiltonian dynamical systems arise in celestial mechanics or electromagnetism. Rabinowitz Floer homology captures the relation between closed solutions of Hamilton’s equations with a fixed energy and the geometry of the corresponding energy hypersurface. Even in the cases where the explicit solutions of Hamilton’s equations cannot be computed, Rabinowitz Floer homology might still be computable and provide information about the existence of closed orbits.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Rolling Reductive Homogeneous Spaces</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="justify">Rollings of a manifold \(M\) over another manifold \(\widehat{M}\) of equal dimension without twist and without slip can be investigated from an intrinsic as well as an extrinsic point of view. In this talk, I focus on intrinsic rollings of reductive homogeneous spaces. More precisely, if \(G / H\) is a reductive homogeneous space equipped with some invariant covariant derivative, where the reductive decomposition \(\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \mathfrak{m}\) is fixed, rollings of \(\mathfrak{m}\) over \(G / H\) are studied.</p>

  <p class="mb-5 justify">In this setting, an explicit description of the configuration space as well as the distribution characterizing intrinsic rollings of \(\mathfrak{m}\) over \(G / H\) can be derived. Moreover, by studying a principal fiber bundle over the configuration space equipped with a suitable principal connection, the so-called kinematic equation is obtained.  That is, for a given control curve, a time-variant ODE on a Lie group whose solutions, projected to the configuration space, are intrinsic rollings of \(\mathfrak{m}\) over \(G / H\).</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Geometric methods for designing optimal filters on Lie groups</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">In control theory, the problem of having available good measurements is of primary importance in order to perform good tracking and control. Unfortunately, in real-life applications, sensing systems do not provide direct measurements about the pose (and its rate) of mechanical systems, while, in other situations, measurements are so noisy that require pre-processing to filter out disturbances and biases. These problems could be faced by using filters and observers. We apply a second-order optimal minimum-energy filter constructed on Lie groups to several planar bodies. We studied the application of the filter to the matrix Lie group TSE(2); moreover, a comparison with the extended Kalman filter is presented. After that, we considered the Chaplygin sleigh case, which is a mechanical system with a nonholonomic constraint. Finally, we applied the filter to a real case scenario consisting of a scaled model representing a parking truck semi-trailer system. Particular attention is paid to the description of the geometric structure that underlies the dynamics and to the choice of the measurement equation, the affine connection, and the other parameters that define the filters. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed filters. The use of Lie groups theory for designing the filters is challenging, but the accuracy of the results, obtained considering the geometric structure and the symmetries of the system justifies the effort.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Reduction by Symmetry and Optimal Control in Riemannian Homogeneous Spaces</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">In this talk, we derive the necessary conditions for optimality in a first-order variational problem on Riemannian homogeneous spaces by making use of the second fundamental form, reinterpreted as a connection on a horizontal distribution on the underlying Lie group. We assume that the action functional admits partial symmetry over some parameter manifold, and use this to reduce the necessary conditions by symmetry. These results are then applied to study a class of optimal control problems on homogeneous spaces, and the particular example of motion planning of robotic manipulators with obstacle avoidance is considered.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Coisotropic reduction in different phase spaces</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">In a classical mechanical system, depending on the underlying phase space, there is a Poisson bracket (which is the case for symplectic and cosymplectic manifolds) or a Jacobi bracket (in the case of contact and cocontact manifolds). With these brackets we can define coisotropic submanifolds, which we can quotient by a canonical involutive distribution on the submanifold. The aim of this talk is to study the different types of inherited structures on these quotients, depending on the relative position of the submanifold to certain canonical distributions defined on the phase space.</p>

  <p class="mb-5 justify">The aim of this talk is to briefly summarize reduction and reconstruction of dynamics in symplectic geometry for Hamiltonian and hyperregular Lagrangian systems. We review classic results and outline possible generalizations.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Linear bundle of Lie algebras applied to the classification of real Lie algebras</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">We present a new look at the classification of real low-dimensional Lie algebras based on the notion of linear bundle of Lie algebras. Belonging to suitable family of Lie bundles entails compatibility of Lie-Poisson structures on dual space to those algebras. It gives us thus compatibility of bi-Hamiltonian structure on space of upper triangular matrices and with a bundle at the algebra level.</p>

  <p><em>Title:</em> Integrable systems on the symplectic realizations of \(\mathbf{e}(3)^*\)</p>
  <em>Abstract:</em>
  <p class="mb-5 justify">Using the \(U(2,2)\)-invariant symplectic structure of the Penrose twistor space we find full and complete \(E(3)\)-equivariant symplectic realizations of some Poisson submanifolds of the Lie-Poisson space \(\mathbf{e}(3)^*\equiv \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3\) dual to the Lie algebra \(\mathbf{e}(3)\) of the Euclidean group \(E(3)\), which is an underlying space in the rigid body theory. Considering concrete integrable cases of gyrostat systems on \(\mathbf{e}(3)^*\) we can take their liftings to the ones on the constructed symplectic realizations. This way we obtain integrable systems on the phase spaces given by the symplectic realizations.</p>
